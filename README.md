# NODE_JS_PRACTICE

This project is a practice repository for Node.js development, focusing on using Express.js and Sequelize.

## Technologies Used

- **Express JS**: Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, ideal for building web applications and APIs.
- **Sequelize**: Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, and more.
